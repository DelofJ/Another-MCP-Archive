# Another MCP Archive
In this repository, you'll find (almost) every official MCP mappings in srg and tsrg format


## A little FAQ, just in case

### Why ?
Because it was a mess to download mappings for older Minecraft versions, so I made this repo to have them available at any time\
I also made a [manifest.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DelofJ/Another-MCP-Archive/master/versions/manifest.json), with it scripts will also be a lot easier

### Where do the mappings come from ?
From 2 sources:\
1 - From the originals MCP zip, available to download [there](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Programs_and_editors/Mod_Coder_Pack), you'll find them in an srg format\
2 - From [MinecraftForge MCPConfig](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MCPConfig), you'll find them in an tsrg format

### Why it only goes up to Minecraft 1.16.4 ?
Since Minecraft 1.16.5, Forge no longer uses MCP mappings but the official Mojang mappings, the existing mappings you'll find in a tsrg2 format do not really deobfuscate the source code of Minecraft, so they're just useless\
For Minecraft 1.16.5+, consider using Minecraft official mappings
